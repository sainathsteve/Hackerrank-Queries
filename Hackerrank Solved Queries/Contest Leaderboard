--Contest Leaderboard
--You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too! The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of  from your result.

SELECT z.hacker_id, h.name, SUM(z.scores)
FROM   (select s.hacker_id, s.challenge_id, MAX(s.score) as scores
        FROM Submissions s
        GROUP BY s.hacker_id, s.challenge_id
        ORDER BY s.hacker_id ASC, s.challenge_id ASC ) AS z
LEFT JOIN Hackers h
     ON z.hacker_id = h.hacker_id
GROUP BY z.hacker_id, h.name
HAVING SUM(z.scores) > 0
ORDER BY SUM(z.scores) DESC, z.hacker_id ASC;
